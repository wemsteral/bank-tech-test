### Requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

```

- Call the account methods to your heart's content.

### Planning

### Approach

I decided to use classes 'Account' & 'Statement', account performs the numerical logic and statement outputs a formatted version of the account history. This is generated by calling a private update method every time the user withdraws or deposits money.
My rationale for using a separate class 'Statement' is that it grants the app with scalability. Potentially, it could become responsible for managing/storing account activity and connecting with a database.
